# Connect

How many times have you missed out on an opportunity to network because you did not bring your resume or did not have a business card?  How many times were you at a networking session and wished it were easier to share your contact information?  Being a co-op student at the University of Waterloo,  I know these situations all too well.  Luckily for us, Connect aims to make connecting easier thus making it easier to grow your network!  Say goodbye to carrying a folder of resumes around or a wallet full of business cards! Connect compiles all social media sites onto one webpage which can be shared to ANYONE at the click of a button! 

## How We Built It
Connect was mainly built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  We use PHP to generate links, handle events, and send and receive information to and from the server.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We tried to use various methods for the implementation of the back end, such as Django, SQLite, and Flask.  However, in the end, we chose to stick with PHP as we were more familiar with it.  Google Tone is the main took used for computers to talk to each other and share users' information.

## What's Next For Connect
This app was meant as a mobile app that allowed users to share their info through NFC.  We could not accomplish this as we did not have the time or knowledge required to pull it off.  We would definitely look towards implementing MySQL or other databases as our userbase grows, and implementing a better way of storing user information (Hash and SALT).
