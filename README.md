# Connect

How many times have you missed out on an opportunity to network because you did not bring your resume or did not have a business card?  How many times were you at a networking session and wished it were easier to share your contact information?  Being a co-op student at the University of Waterloo,  I know these situations all too well.  Luckily for us, Connect aims to make connecting easier thus making it easier to grow your network. Say goodbye to carrying a folder of resumes around or a wallet full of business cards. Connect compiles all social media sites onto one webpage which can be shared to ANYONE at the click of a button! 

## How We Built It
Connect is a web app, built on HTML, CSS, and PHP.  We use PHP to generate social media links using the username input (Without requiring passwords), save profile infromation to our text file data base,and generate profiles.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We tried to use various methods for the implementation of the back end, such as Django, SQLite, and Flask.  However, in the end, we chose to stick with PHP as it worked well with file handling. Google Tone is the main tool used for computers to communicate with each other and share users' information.

## What's Next For Connect
This app is meant as a mobile app that allowed users to share their info through NFC.  We accomplished this web app as a proof of conduct.  We are currently working as a team to impliment this as an Android App that uses NFC to communicate profile information, and no longer relies on Google Tone.
